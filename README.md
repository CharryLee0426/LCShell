# Lichen's Shell Script Collection

## 1. Brief Introduction
This is a repo that collected some shell scripts that written by myself. They can improve my developing efficiency. Also, I improve my shell programming skill when I write them to simplify my workflow.

## 2. Installation
First, you can clone the repo to local.

```bash
git clone xxx shell
```

Then go to the directory above and give the scripts execution permission. For example, you can use the following command to give `createPyVenv.sh` execution permission:

```bash
# Assumed that you are in the repo's directory.
# If not, please use cd to go to this directory.

chmod 744 createPyVenv.sh
```

You can excute it using `./createPyVenv.sh` to run this script first time. After restarting the terminal, you can use simple command to run this script.

It's OK that you just go to the website and copy the script to your own shell script. However, I don't suggest this way. You must pay attention to that you can't delete or move the script after running it. Or you can't use simple command and the system must add extra information to make `$PATH` available.

## 3. What's More
I want to write more scripts that can help me and others. And I'm very glad to see that some guys use my script and give my some good suggestions.
